Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Zack. I'm a career changer and aspiring [software craftsman](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer&qid=1591551601&s=books&sr=1-1) based in Bristol, UK.

I have 12 years' experience delivering in challenging circumstances across the world during my career in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines.

Right now, I'm learning how to write great software.

I use this site to reflect on my journey, signpost the resources that have helped me and talk about projects I am working on.

I'm looking for a fun team that really cares about code quality where I can learn from great people.

Does it sound like we're into the same stuff? [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zack-adlington), I'd love to hear from you.
