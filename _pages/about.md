Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Zack. I'm a junior software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I work at Made Tech, a consultancy that does [software-y stuff](https://www.madetech.com/services) for the UK public sector using open source and cloud technologies.

Before I became a software engineer, I spent 12 years delivering in challenging circumstances across the world during my career in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines.

I use this site to reflect on my journey, signpost the resources that have helped me and talk about personal projects I am working on.

Does it sound like we're into the same stuff? [Get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zack-adlington), I'd love to hear from you.
